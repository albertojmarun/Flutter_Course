## Personal Point of View ðŸ‘€
The course is taking into account that you already knows the basics from a programming language and you are learning Dart &amp; as a second programming language.
This is really helpful if you code before learning Dart.

### Flutter 0:
The first video explains you how to install the Dart SDK and the Flutter SDK, and creates the first Flutter Project (In the repositorie is the hola directory).

### Flutter 1:
In this video, he is showing the basic data types in Flutter and explains how to use it.
The most important think is the data type of dynamic and var.

He (and me) separate the course in functions to make it more readable.

### Flutter 2:
It shows how to use the functions, what you can do, how, the parameters (really useful), return.

** The tutorial is made it with a Flutter Version of 2019, it doesnt contains the null safety **

### Flutter 3:
Here, the main purpose is to explain the Control Structures, and explains the if, else if, else; switch;  tables; for loop, for loop for lists, while loop.

### Flutter 4:
The files of DART_CLASES.dart and PERSONA.dart are the Example of the videos.

The most important things to highlight is that you can have more than one class inside a file.

You can have the more than one constructor, adding: NameOfTheClass.whatever(parameters...)
There is the method 'toString()' that you can override to make your own method.

You can make a variable, method, constant... private adding a '_' before, example: _variable

To make a getter or a setter you can do =>
type get/set name(parameter)

To import a file that you create, you'll only need: import 'file.dart';

Then, the video 4B (As the author named) there is an example of how to import objects from JSON. The example is the folder 'SPACEX_JSON'
