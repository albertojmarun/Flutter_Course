## Personal Point of View ðŸ‘€
The course is taking into account that you already knows the basics from a programming language and you are learning Dart &amp; as a second programming language.
This is really helpful if you code before learning Dart.

### Flutter 0:
The first video explains you how to install the Dart SDK and the Flutter SDK, and creates the first Flutter Project (In the repositorie is the hola directory).

### Flutter 1:
In this video, he is showing the basic data types in Flutter and explains how to use it.
The most important think is the data type of dynamic and var.

He (and me) separate the course in functions to make it more readable.

### Flutter 2:
It shows how to use the functions, what you can do, how, the parameters (really useful), return.

** The tutorial is made it with a Flutter Version of 2019, it doesnt contains the null safety **

### Flutter 3:
Here, the main purpose is to explain the Control Structures, and explains the if, else if, else; switch;  tables; for loop, for loop for lists, while loop.
