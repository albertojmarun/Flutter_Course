/// UPLOAD IMAGES
/// To Upload Images you can use:
///  Image.network (Taking an URL) or Image.asset(Taking an Image that you upload on your Project).
///
/// When you are going to work with files or something, it is important to create a folder name assets and there you will upload the files.
///
/// And in the pubspec.yaml you need to uncomment the assets and add your own assets.
